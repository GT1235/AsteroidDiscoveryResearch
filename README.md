# AsteroidDiscoveryResearch

Hi! Thanks for checking out my asteroid discovery research code!

Some Notes:
- Some libraries are imported more than once, just because I often pasted necessary imports from my smaller notebooks.
- This repo has the main notebooks I used in the final few months of research, as opposed to all 2.5 years of work I've done.
