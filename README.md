# AsteroidDiscoveryResearch

Hi! Thanks for checking out my asteroid discovery research code! This repo has the main notebooks I used in the final few months of research, as opposed to all 2.5 years of work I've done. 


Some Notes:
- Some libraries are imported more than once, just because I often pasted necessary imports from my smaller notebooks.
- All code was written by me, unless otherwise stated in the cell itself.
- Since this was a multiyear research effort, there isn't one single notebook with all of the important code. Instead, each noteook hosts a different step of the AI pipeline.
- I've left the notebooks unedited from my raw research work.
